          <h2>Definition</h2>
          <p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1. An event with a probability of 1 is certain to occur, while an event with a probability of 0 is impossible.</p>
        <p>Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the chance that a stated event will occur.</p>

          <h2>Formulas</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Probability of an event (P): P = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes</li>
            <li>Joint probability: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B given A)</li>
            <li>Conditional probability: P(A given B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</li>
